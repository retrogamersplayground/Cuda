for the button on top it would have been better to use <a> instead of <button>

oh and text in button should have been real text not part of the image

logo and nav are not really align look at design

the button text where it says work with us should be text not just part of the image is what i meant

that line under the titles look a bit weird
yeah the hr looks weird

fir these social icons in the bottom where there is olivia wilde make them closer together


and instead of using hr tag use :after on the h2 its better

sumbit button text center

input placeholder text white and positioned

textarea placeholder text white and positioned. 


center pink section ul
